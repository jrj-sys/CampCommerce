## Installation
To install, clone the repository to the directory of your choosing. Navigate to the repository root folder and create a `.env` file. In this `.env` file, you will need three values: `DB_NAME='campcommerce'`, `DB_USER='root'`, and `DB_PW='Enter your MySQL password here!'`. Next, run `npm i` and `npm run seed` within your terminal to install node dependencies and seed the database with dummy data. Ideally, you also want to install nodemon as a development dependency if you plan to update the code.
